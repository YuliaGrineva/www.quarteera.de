In the last two years, many queer artists from Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine have been forced to leave their homelands. War, repression, and discrimination have driven them to seek safety in other countries, where they now face new problems, challenges, and discoveries.

Quarteera e.V., with the support of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs within the framework of the Civil Society Cooperation program, invites queer artists in exile to participate in this grant competition for cultural projects.

## БАННЕР

## Goals
We aim to preserve alternative culture, promote cultural exchange, and foster mutual understanding between queer refugees and the host society.

This grant is intended to support artists who express their experiences as queer refugees in their works, in order to:

* Demonstrate the variety of queer refugees’ life paths and cultures.
* Highlight the experiences of queer artists working in exile.
* Support queer artists and amplify their voices.

**Your experiences — whether positive, negative, or extraordinary — and your voice are important to us. We want you to be heard, understood, and accepted in your new countries. Your artwork will also serve as a source of support for others.**
**Your voice can make a difference!**

## Q&A

### Application Process

**Who can apply? **

Queer refugees from Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine with previous cultural and artistic experience are eligible to participate.

**Can I submit multiple applications?**

You can submit only one application per kind of art. One person or group cannot receive financing for more than one project. 
If you have two new projects of different art kinds, you can submit both. Please prioritize quality over quantity in your applications. The jury will assess the artistic value of the projects first and foremost.

**Can I participate if I emigrated more than 2 years ago?**

Yes, you can, but priority will be given to recent queer refugees. However, this is not the only or main selection criterion. The relevance of your project to the competition’s topic and goals is the most important factor.

**Can I submit my application in my native language?**

To ensure timely assessment, applications are limited to these languages only - Russian (the organization’s functional language) and English (the most commonly used language).

**What if I meet all the criteria but reside outside Germany and the Eastern Partnership countries? **

This competition is designed to support queer refugees residing in the Eastern Partnership countries (Armenia, Georgia, Moldova) or Germany. We understand that creative groups may be spread globally and people often change their country of residence. Some expenses incurred outside the listed countries can be covered (e.g., a fee for a group member in another country or a travel ticket to one of the listed countries for them). However, all project events must take place in one of the listed countries. Material purchases or space rentals are only possible in the listed countries. We can only sign a cooperation agreement with an individual applicant or a group representative residing in one of the listed countries.

**Is it possible to receive financing if I reside in Russia or Belarus?**

Unfortunately, we cannot transfer money to Belarus or Russia due to legal reasons.

**What does the financing range of 1,000 to 5,000 euros mean? Who determines the actual amount?**

Your application must include a financial plan for the project. Necessary financing varies among projects. For example, filming production costs differ from those for recording a song. If all selected projects have similar production costs, financing will be shared equally. Otherwise, the jury will distribute funds proportionally based on project needs.

### Competition Results

**When and how will I be informed about the jury’s decision?**

All applicants will be informed via email about the selection results. We expect to finish the selection by the end of August. The exact date cannot be determined yet, as it depends on the number of applications received.

**If my application is selected, do I have to be interviewed by the jury?**

Yes, it is important to interview every finalist before announcing the results and project start. The interview helps to determine the actual amount of financing your project needs.

**If my project is not selected, will I be informed?**

Yes, all applicants will be informed about their project’s status. However, please remember that the jury’s decision is final and indisputable.

### Project Implementation and Financing

**Can the project be made in my native language?**

Yes, we encourage you to create your project in your native language.

**What if I can’t complete the project before the deadline?**

The project is initiated by signing a cooperation agreement with Quarteera e.V., which outlines all responsibilities. We cannot pay for incomplete projects. All financing received for project needs must be returned if the project is not completed.

**What will happen after the project is completed?**

We hope your cultural project will continue beyond this competition and reach a wide audience. You can strengthen your application by providing further plans for your projects development and promotion. If you don’t have a clear plan yet, we can help you to develop a strategy. We are also interested in promoting your projects during events organized by Quarteera e.V.

**What project costs can be covered by the financing?**
* Fees for you and your project team members
* Production of promotional materials (posters, flyers, etc.)
* Project material costs (including equipment rental)
* Room rental for performances or exhibitions
* Necessary software
* Travel and accommodation costs (on special occasions)

**What is the finalists festival? Are all finalists required to attend?**
The finalists festival will take place on 07.12.2024 at PANDA Platforma in Berlin. Some finalists will present their projects in person, while others will present online. We will decide based on the preliminary results of the projects.

**When can I start working on my project?**
Work on your project should not start before the cooperation agreement is signed. The official project start date is 01.09.2024. Expenses incurred before this date cannot be covered. However, if you start earlier, results achieved before the official start can be included in your project.

**When can I receive the financing for my project?**

Financing is provided after signing a cooperation agreement with Quarteera e.V. Payments are made in tranches according to the approved financial plan. Fees for project co-executors can be paid directly by Quarteera e.V.

### Copyright and Reporting

**What kind of reporting is required after project completion?**

After project completion, you must submit two reports: a narrative report (describing what was done) and a financial report. All expenses covered by the financing must be documented with receipts or invoices, which must be sent to Quarteera e.V. with the financial report.

**Who will own the copyright for my project?**

You will retain the copyright for your project. However, it is important that Quarteera e.V. can use your project for educational and community development purposes.

If you have any questions, please contact us via queerekultur@quarteera.de
